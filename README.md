# binance-multisender
 Simple and fast, linked to Binance-API multisender

<h2>Step 1.</h2>
 Open and edit config API keys. Simply by entering self-generated API keys from Binance. <i>(Do not forget to turn on withdrawal option and IP restriction, since this program doesn't use any kind of proxies)</i>

<h2>Step 2.</h2>
 Enter as many addresses as you wish in config. <b>BEWARE</b>: addresses do not clear after script run. So if you want to change array of addresses, you gotta take care of them before you start this script running.
 
<h2>Step 3.</h2>
 If you have your config done, open console in the directory and type "npm start". Follow the commands, little sybil enjoyer.
